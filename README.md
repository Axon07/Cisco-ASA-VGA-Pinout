# Cisco ASA Firewall (-x Models) 16-Pin VGA Pinout Guide

This repository provides detailed information about the 16-pin VGA connector found on the motherboard of Cisco ASA firewalls with model numbers ending in `-x` (e.g., ASA 5506-X, ASA 5516-X). These models feature a unique 16-pin VGA header that differs from standard VGA connectors. This guide includes a pinout description, an ASCII diagram of the layout, and notes on connecting it to a monitor using female-to-female jumper wires.

## Overview

The Cisco ASA -x series firewalls include a 16-pin VGA header on the motherboard, which can be used to connect to a monitor's standard 15-pin VGA male plug. This guide documents the pin assignments and physical layout of the 16-pin header, as well as a reference to the standard VGA pinout for compatibility.


## Pinout Description

The 16-pin VGA header on the Cisco ASA -x motherboard follows this pin assignment:

| Pin | Function           | Notes                      |
|-----|--------------------|----------------------------|
| 1   | Red Video         | RGB red signal             |
| 2   | Green Video       | RGB green signal           |
| 3   | Blue Video        | RGB blue signal            |
| 4   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 5   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 6   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 7   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 8   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 9   | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 10  | Sync Ground       | Ground for sync signals    |
| 11  | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 12  | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 13  | Horizontal Sync   | HSync signal               |
| 14  | Vertical Sync     | VSync signal               |
| 15  | N/C               | Not connected              |
| 16  | Blank             | No pin present on board    |

**Notes:**
- Pins marked "N/C" (Not Connected) do not have a function in this configuration.
- Pin 16 is physically absent on the motherboard header.

## Physical Layout (ASCII Diagram)

The 16-pin VGA header is a 2-row, 8-column layout. Pin 1 starts at the **top-right** and progresses leftward across the top row, while Pin 2 starts at the **bottom-right** and moves leftward across the bottom row. Below is an ASCII representation of the pin layout:


## Connecting to a Monitor

To connect the ASA -x VGA header to a monitor, use female-to-female jumper wires to map the motherboard pins to a standard 15-pin VGA male plug (monitor side). Below is the pinout for a standard VGA male connector for reference:


### Wiring Guide
Map the ASA motherboard pins to the monitor VGA pins as follows:

| ASA Pin | Function       | Monitor Pin | Function       |
|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1       | Red Video      | 1           | Red Video      |
| 2       | Green Video    | 2           | Green Video    |
| 3       | Blue Video     | 3           | Blue Video     |
| 10      | Sync Ground    | 10          | Sync Ground    |
| 13      | Horizontal Sync| 13          | Horizontal Sync|
| 14      | Vertical Sync  | 14          | Vertical Sync  |

JTAG pins on the ASA:

      \------------------------------------/



## Usage Instructions
1. Locate the 16-pin VGA header on your Cisco ASA -x firewall motherboard.
2. Use female-to-female jumper wires to connect the pins as outlined in the wiring guide.
3. Attach the other end of the jumper wires to a standard VGA male cable connected to your monitor.
4. Power on the firewall and monitor to verify the display output.
